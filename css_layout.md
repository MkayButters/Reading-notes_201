## Layout

- CSS treats each HTML element as if its in its own box.

- Positioning schemes are used in CSS to control the layout of the page

    - Using normal flow scheme, every block level element appears on a new line
    - Using the relative positioning scheme, the element is shifted to the top, bottom, right, or left of where it should have been placed.
    - Using the absolute positioning scheme, takes the element out of normal flow, which means that it does not affect the position of any of the other elements.

- The z-index is a noteable element to use in future projects.

- The `float` property allows you move an element in normal flow to place is far right or far left as possible of the containing element.

- Using the property `clear` will make sure no other elements touch the sides (left or right) of the element.

- In this day and age there is many different devices that will be accessing your website. It is important that the design works on a range of different screens.

- Most web designers create pages of around 960-1000 pixels in width.

- Fixed width layout designs do not change sizes as the users browser window is increased or decreased.

    - This is done by using the specific pixel rule (px), in your elements.

- Liquid layout stretches and contracts based on the size of the users browser window.

    - This is done by using a percentage rule (%), inside your element.

- CSS frameworks is a tool to make life easier by providing the code for common tasks.
