## Error Handling and Debugging

- It is important to understand errors and how they work before.

    - Here are a list of possible errors;

    1. SyntaxError- incorrect use of the rules of the language (typo).

    2. ReferenceError - a varriable that is not declared or out of scope.
    
    3. EvalError - incorect use of a function.

    4. URIError - incorrect use of a function.

    5. TypeError - use of an object or method that does not exist.

    6. RangeError - calling a function using number outside its accepted range.
    
    7. Error - generic error

    8. NaN - not an error, mathematical operation using a value thats not a number


- Debugging is the process of finding error by involving the process of deduction. By eliminating potential causes of an error.

- Setting up breakpoints will help with debugging by pausing the excution of a script on any line.

- The console and dev tools are built into the browser to help you hunt for errors.

- The order of excution is important in debugging. Some tasks cannont be complete until another statement or function has been ran.

- If the excution context and stacks are understood, there is a more likelyhood to find an error in your code.

- If you know that you may get an error use the `try , catch , finally` statments to give the user helpful feedback.
