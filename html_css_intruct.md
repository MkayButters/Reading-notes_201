- There are many levels of elements used to design you HTML structure of your webpage.
    - [Check out this for HTML elements cheat sheet](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php).

- Visual editors are basically a quicker method to use HTML without having to write out the code.

## Introducing CSS

- First imagine that there is an invisible "box" around every HTML element.
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way each individual "box" is presented.

- CSS consists of a rule.
- Each rule contains two parts; a _selector_ and a __declaration__.

    - A _selector_ indicates which element the rule applys to.

    - A __declaration__ indicates how the element refered to in the _selector_ should be styled.
        - A __declaration__ are comprised of 2 parts; a property and a value, which are sperated by a colon.
            - Properties indicate the aspect you want to change, wether it be the color, font, width, etc.
            - Values specifiy the settings of the property ie. yellow, blue, Arial

- CSS may appear in a separate document and be linked into an HTML.

## Basic Javascript

- Each indiviual instruction given to JavaScript is known as a statement and should end with semicolon.
- Comments are widely used in JavaScript to explain what the code does; write comments by typing `//` into your code line.
- Variables are a helpful tool to store data in a simple "bucket" that can be repeated and used throughout your code line.

- There are 6 rules you must follow when giving a variable a name.
    1. Name cannot start with a number
    2. Names cannot have a dash or a period in them.
    3. Cannot use keyword or reserved words. [Cheat Sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp).
    4. All variable names are case sensitive.
    5. Use a name that describes the information thats stored in the variable
    6. No spaces in a variable name

- An array is a special type of variable that stores a list of values.

 - An expression results in a single value; there are two types of expressions
    1. Expression that just assign a value to a variable
        - ie. `var color = 'beige';`
        - The value of the color i now beige.
    
    2. Expression that use two or more values to return a single value
        - ie. `var area = 3 * 2;`
        - The value of the area is now 6.

    - Expressions rely on operators which allow creation of a single value from one or more values.
        - Arithmetic Operators
            - ie. subtraction, multiplication, and modulus
        
        - String Operators
            - The symbol `+` is used to combine strings together on either side of the `+`.


## Decisions & Loops

- There are two components to a decision
    1. An expression is evaluated, which returns a value
        - The value returns as either true or false

    2. A conditional statement say what to do in a given situation
        - The value is based on the if/then/else concept.
