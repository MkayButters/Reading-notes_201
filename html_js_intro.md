        - Each element has a opening and closing tag `<h1>where you put your info</h1>`.

    - Attributes describe more about elements.
        - Attributes are made two parts: _name_ and _value_ and are seperated by an `=` sign.
            - The _name_ indicates the information being supplied to the element.
            - The _value_ is the information or setting for the attribute.

- HTML5 introduces a new set of elements to help define the structure of your webpage.
    - These include elements that help you divide up a page; ie. `<div>`.
    - Also headers and footers that appear on the top or the bottom of every page on the site.
    - Instead of using `<div>` to always divide up elements you can use many others ie. `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<sections>`, `<hgroup>` and many more.
