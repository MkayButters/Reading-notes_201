## Lists

- Order lists are created with the `<ol>` tag.

- Unordered lists are created with the `<ul>` tag.

- Each list item is placed within the `<li>` tag.

- Definition lists are created using the `<dl>` tag, and are used to define terminology.

    - The `<dt>` is used to contain the term being defined
    - The `<dd>` is used to contain the definition

- Lists can be nested inside each other


## Boxes

- Using _width_ and _height_, sets the dimensions for a box.

- To specify the size of a box are by using pixels, percentages, or ems.

- You can use min- or max- to limit the maxium width or heigth.

- Borders are used as boxes too.

- Borders can be colored values to make the boxes pop out more.

- Padding is also used to create boxes

- Margins are used to move your boxes across the page

## Arrays

- An array basically stores a list or set of values that are related to each other.

- Each item in an array or given a number called an index.

- To retrieve the items on the list the array name is speciified along with the index number in square brackets.

- Each array has a property called 'length' which holds the number of items in the array.

## Decisions and Loops pt. 2 

- "if...else" statements allow you to provide 2 sets of code

    1. If the condition evaluates true
    2. If the condition is false
- Switch statements are used to present the user with a different message depending on which _level_ they are at

    - The variable _level_ contains a number indicating what level the user is on.

- JavaScript can convert data types to complete an operation. This is known as type coercion.

- Fasly values are treated as if they are false. They also can be treated as the number 0.

- Truthy values are treated as if they are true.

- Using == false, 0 , and ' ' (an empty string) all result in a truthy statement.

- Undefined == null is also a truthy statement.

- NaN is considered falsy all the time because it is not equivalent to anything even itself

- Short circut values are a very bad shortcut

- Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. It will repeat until the condition returns false.

- Loops are very helpful when deal with arrays.

- There are three types of loops; for, while, and do while.
