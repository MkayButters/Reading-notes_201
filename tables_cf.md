## Domain modeling

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

- An and object-oriented model is an entity that store data in properties and encapsulate behaviors in methods.

- Using the constructor function you can define the same properties between many objects.

    - The construction function is defined by using a function expression.

- Object-oriented programming in JavaScript

    1. The `new` keyword creates an object

    2. The constructor function initializes properies inside that object using 
    `this.` variable.

    3. The object is store in a variable for later use.


## Tables

- A table represents information in a grid format

- HTML elements to create tables:
    1. <table> ; used to create a table.

    2. <tr> ; used to start each row of the table.

    3. <td> ; used to represent each cell of the table within the <tr> element.

- A Table Heading is <th> that represents the heading for either a column or a row

- There are three elements that distinguish between that first and last rows of the main content

    1. <thead> ; the headings inside the table

    2. <tbody> ; the body should sit inside

    3. <tfoot> ; the footer of the table


## Objects

- The `new` keyword and the object constructor create a blank object.

- To update the value of properties use the `.` notation or `[]`

- The constructor notation help create several object to represent similar things.
    - Create the template with the objects properties and methods
    - Using the `new` function you can create instances of the object to create a new object using the same functions created above in the constructor function
    
- The keyword `this` is commonly used inside functions and objects, it always refers to one object usually the object in which the function operates.

Word definitions:

1. Global scope/ global context - a function that is created at the top level of a script.
    - Global variables also become properties of the window object

2. Method of an object - a function that is defined inside an object the function becomes a method.
    - If a function has been defined in a global scope and it is a method of an object, `this` refers to the object contained within it.

3. Variable - a variable has one key "name" and one key value
    - Variable names are seperated from their value by an `=` sign.

4. Arrays - they store multiple pieces of information within a `[]` sperated by a `,`.

5. Browser Object Model - creates a model of the browser tab or window
